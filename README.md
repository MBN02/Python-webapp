# Build a Docker Jenkins Pipeline to Implement CI/CD Workflow

You must use the following tools:

- Docker: To build the application from a Dockerfile and push it to Docker Hub
- Docker Hub: To store the Docker image
- GitHub: To store the application code and track its revisions
- Git: To connect and push files from the local system to GitHub
- Linux (Ubuntu): As a base operating system to start and execute the project
- Jenkins: To automate the deployment process during continuous integration

Following requirements should be met:

- Document the step-by-step process from the initial installation to the final stage
- Track the versions of the code in the GitHub repository
- Availability of the application in the Docker Hub
- Track the build status of Jenkins for every increment of the project
